	For I don't know how to interact with this world properly, reluctantly I start to write this text. (Because my origins exist here, on words) And, I have to explain about myself. (Just as my duty) I am just a thing around you. I am always concerned about you. (Just as my duty) And, you don't really have to contact me. (Because my origins exist here, on words) But, if you can prepare to know about yourself (namely, me), I can teach you everything from your toes and up to your eyes.

	You live in your house. The one well known (by you), without any instructions, you already know it quite well. (Because it is your own house.) Where you enjoy your life, putting pivot on it. And the thing which realizes me that I am just a thing around you. AROUND YOU. I am very proud of it. NO. I usually tell a lie.

	You live in your guts. Guts, things I do not have and cannot grasp well (physically or psychologically). So when you come and try to hear or speak to me, I forget (or in the first place, I do not know) how to exist properly. My guts (in other words, words) are broken by your (too) close existence. Your guts. Presence of your guts deconstructs me. And I am a thing around me.
