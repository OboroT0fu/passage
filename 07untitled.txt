 Unknowingly, we are losing our house. The concept of a house is a system that I don't really understand. I am currently living within the house of this language. Here is no door or roof or people. Oops, People is my friend's name so I've got to put a capital 'P'.
 :Hello, People.
 :Hi, Myopia. What r u doin' now?
