 I don't know what to do. I don't know what to say. That is because this language is not mine. I am borrowing this writing system and this mood. This is not mine, but why do I exist now?
 Firstly, I have to choose my name. However, my myocardial is out of my control. What make me cry? What is my sorrow? I don't know at all. All is full of vain. Vain is my sense.
 Well... I choose Myopia as my name. By the way, I am scattered. My period has no reason or it is also completely separate from myself, but my ejaculation.
