 あなたが時間に退屈を感じるのであれば、それなら私を読めばいいのに。間延びした夕方に窓の外から、私の目に橙色の衝撃が現れて待つ。おそらく、この世界には外側がない。それゆえに、内側というのも有り得ない。あなたがいないと息ができないのを知っていた。けれど、あなたを知らない。
 私はSatanを見た。
 You should follow my directions, and I should describe carefully for you.
 First, it has ears to hear surroundings, and eyes to observe. To note, the overall impression is white like drifting winter.
 Maybe you would say you couldn't draw without information about the outline. But, I don't think so, as you are already eating me.
 In the Kremlin castle, you said to me that I was spelling like those in literature, and I said your speech resembled that of a journalist who lives in urban areas. As the winter air arrives, I can easily recall the scenes with you. On that travel's way home I already saw another Satan, black as the coffee you were drinking at that time. However, the train we rode was too fast for me to collect my thoughts scattered around. The Satan was also scattered in my sight 習字教室の匂いのように. Frightened by the sudden appearence of the servant from the demon world, I turned to you next to my seat, hoping for help, but you said nothing. The uncertain Satan told me that I was nothing but butter on a plate. The train was into a deep forest, screaming as if Asian women were reproducted by copier in my office. And noticed that I was being eaten from the left arm by you, who were sleeping and dreamed of by the Satan. I tried to pull my left arm out, but actually, it began to melt down in my sight.
 And now, there are two sibling Satans in my room.
